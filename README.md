This project is a landing page for a fictional travel destination. The goal was to become more familiar with applying CSS flexbox to display HTML elements. As well, I had the opportunity to experiment with various button animations and various ways to display images in webpages. I was able to create a meaningful color scheme that reflected the desired feelings to be evoked upon visiting the webpage, that is, a sense of calm and of wonder. All images used are original digital art pieces created on iPad Procreate.
